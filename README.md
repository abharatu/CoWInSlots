I have created a script to check for slots and notify user via mac notification center. To run the script you would need to have basic understanding of Terminal App in Mac.

## Dependencies:

1. brew:
   - You would need brew to install python3 if you dont have it already.
2. Python3:
   - ```brew install python3```
3. pync:
   - ```pip install pync```

## Steps:
1. Make sure the above dependencies are installed via Terminal
2. clone the project using ```git clone  https://github.com/abharatu/CoWInSlots.git```
3. type ```cd CoWInSlots```
4. and then type ```./run.sh```
5. Follow the instructions in the script.
6. To exit out of the script type Ctrl+C
